# Roadmap

What's built and what's next. Per-feature **how** (plan → review → implement → sweep) lives in
`ai_docs/dev_flow.md`. Operational landmines/triggers live in `ai_docs/todo.md`. Design decisions
with revisit triggers live in `ai_docs/conventions.md ## Design decisions`.

Features are the planning unit: each is `ai_docs/features/NNN_name.md` (or a commit, for small ones
with no standalone spec). The **Active context** banner answers "what's next?"; the first `pending`
row (if any) is the next feature.

Status vocabulary: **pending** / **in progress** / **done** / **partial** (code shipped but a
follow-up is tracked — see linked spec/todo) / **superseded** (an earlier shape replaced by a later
feature; brief points at the superseder).

<!-- Row shape:
     | NNN | name | status | <what-it-does, ONE sentence>. Spec: <ai_docs/features/NNN_*.md | commit <sha>>. |
     Hard rule: ONE markdown table row, no multi-line narrative. Landed-reality (file paths touched,
     test counts, the bug-fix story, review-round detail) belongs in the feature spec or the commit
     message, NOT the row. If a row wants a second descriptive sentence, that sentence belongs in the
     spec. Status is ONE value from the vocabulary above — no compound forms.

## Active context

<!-- Rewrite this block IN FULL each time it changes. Do NOT append. <=200 words. -->
<!-- Date stamp = last edit of this block, not the date of the work it summarises. -->

**As of 2026-05-28.**

- **Shipped: `v0.10.0`** (features 014 + 015 + 016 — shader library + lib file management UI).
  `dev` == `master`, nothing unshipped.
- The shader library: write `SB_*` helpers in `<app_data_dir>/lib/`, call them by name, `Ctrl+P`
  to browse/insert; manage lib files (tree + right-click context menus) from the picker.
- **NEXT ACTION:** none queued — pick the next feature from `todo.md` triggers or a fresh ask.
- **itch store page (`page.yaml`) not yet updated for the shader library** — flagged at ship
  time; do a `## Sync the itch.io page` pass when convenient.
- **No open BLOCKERs.**
