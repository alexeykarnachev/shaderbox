# Roadmap

What's built and what's next. Per-feature **how** (plan → review → implement → sweep) lives in
`ai_docs/dev_flow.md`. Operational landmines/triggers live in `ai_docs/todo.md`. Design decisions
with revisit triggers live in `ai_docs/conventions.md ## Design decisions`.

Features are the planning unit: each is `ai_docs/features/NNN_name.md` (or a commit, for small ones
with no standalone spec). The **Active context** banner answers "what's next?"; the first `pending`
row (if any) is the next feature.

Status vocabulary: **pending** / **in progress** / **done** / **partial** (code shipped but a
follow-up is tracked — see linked spec/todo) / **superseded** (an earlier shape replaced by a later
feature; brief points at the superseder).

<!-- Row shape:
     | NNN | name | status | <what-it-does, ONE sentence>. Spec: <ai_docs/features/NNN_*.md | commit <sha>>. |
     Hard rule: ONE markdown table row, no multi-line narrative. Landed-reality (file paths touched,
     test counts, the bug-fix story, review-round detail) belongs in the feature spec or the commit
     message, NOT the row. If a row wants a second descriptive sentence, that sentence belongs in the
     spec. Status is ONE value from the vocabulary above — no compound forms.

<!-- Rewrite this block IN FULL each time it changes. Do NOT append. <=200 words. -->
<!-- Date stamp = last edit of this block, not the date of the work it summarises. -->

**As of 2026-05-22.**

- **Done through feature 007; v0.2.1 shipped to itch.** All on `master`, pushed (commits + tags
  `v0.2.0`, `v0.2.1` on origin; 0.2.1 = a `run.bat` errorlevel patch). Feature 007 =
  release-pipeline hardening: `make release VERSION=x.y.z`
  (semver bump + tag; policy in `conventions.md`), `build.sh` gated on `make check` + `make smoke`
  + clean tree (`--allow-dirty`), both platforms ship `.zip`, GitHub Actions CI, `BUILDING.md`,
  bundle-UX rewrite (`scripts/README.md` + launchers). The full ship flow is `BUILDING.md`; the
  itch store page is synced from `ai_docs/itch/page.yaml` via `dev_flow.md ### Sync the itch.io
  page` (done this session: ModelBox claim killed, copy/tags actualized; fetch-back-audited clean).
- **Two open follow-ups (non-blocking, no users yet so neither gates anything):**
  1. **The shipped build was NOT runtime-verified on Windows** — built + CI-installed on Linux,
     never run on a real Windows box (0.2.1's `run.bat` errorlevel fix is itself Windows-unverified).
     Verify the *published* build per `BUILDING.md` when convenient.
  2. **Screenshots are stale** — the live page's images predate gruvbox (005) + the inline editor
     (006). Re-shoot in-app + upload by hand (binary, not in `page.yaml`).
- **`todo.md` deferrals fire on their own triggers** — do NOT speculatively pick them up.
- **No open BLOCKERs.** Live DEFERRAL-class workaround: the `imgui_color_text_edit` render() FPE
  (editor hidden behind modals, `todo.md`).

## Features

| # | Name | Status | Brief |
|---|---|---|---|
| 007 | release_pipeline_hardening | done | `make release VERSION=` (semver bump + tag), `build.sh` gated on check+smoke + clean tree (`--allow-dirty`), `.zip` both platforms, Windows+Ubuntu CI, `BUILDING.md`. Spec: `ai_docs/features/007_release_pipeline_hardening.md`. |
| 006 | inline_glsl_editor | done | Syntax-highlighted inline GLSL editor in the main window's left split; Ctrl+S saves + hot-reloads; visual-options popup; replaced the external-editor mechanism. Spec: `ai_docs/features/006_inline_editor.md`. |
| 005 | ui_redesign_foundation | partial | Gruvbox theme + full color/size/spacing token sweep through `theme.py`. The wide-screen layout half was reverted to the feature-004 shape; only the theme survived. Spec: `ai_docs/features/005_ui_redesign_foundation.md`. |
| 004 | imgui_bundle_migration | done | Full pyimgui → imgui-bundle migration; adopted the `imgui_ctx` context-manager idiom + `portable_file_dialogs`; stripped the 8 imgui `# type: ignore` markers. Spec: `ai_docs/features/004_imgui_bundle_migration.md`. |
| 003 | modelbox_removal | done | Wiped all ModelBox integration (HTTP client, settings UI, app-state fields, `requests` dep); app_state migration gen 3. Spec: `ai_docs/features/003_modelbox_removal.md`. |
| 002 | ui_widgets_extraction | done | Three-layer split: `app.py` (state) / `ui.py` (orchestrator) / `widgets`+`popups`+`tabs` (pure draw fns); `ui.py` 1508 → 294. Spec: `ai_docs/features/002_ui_widgets_extraction.md`. |
| 001 | exporter_refactor | done | `exporters/` subpkg — `Exporter` ABC + `RenderedArtifact` value type + registry; Telegram ported to own worker thread + asyncio loop + sticker UI. Spec: `ai_docs/features/001_exporter_refactor.md`. |
| — | hotkeys_extraction | done | Pulled the hotkey block out of `ui.py` into `hotkeys.py::process_hotkeys(app)`. Spec: commit `c7d6359`. |
| — | smoke_test | done | `scripts/smoke.py` + `make smoke`: 200 headless frames of `update_and_draw`, asserts popup-mutex + `current_node_id` invariants. Spec: commit `92f221a`. |
| — | pyright_blocking | done | Dropped `\|\| true` from the pyright pre-commit hook — typecheck now blocks on failure; repo at 0 errors. Spec: commit `d1fdf65`. |
| — | devflow_scaffold | done | Created `CLAUDE.md` cold-start chain + `ai_docs/{dev_flow,todo,conventions}.md` + `/sanitize` skill + `Makefile`. Spec: commit `cd430d1`. |
