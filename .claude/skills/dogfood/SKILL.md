<command-name>dogfood</command-name>

Drive the REAL copilot ENGINE end-to-end, headless on the Pi (no App, no glfw window), against a real
LLM. Create a `ProjectSession` on a standalone EGL context, send turns, watch the tool calls + compile
feedback, render images, OPEN them and judge by eye. The judge is YOU (reading the trace + the PNGs) —
there are NO code assertions. The point is to test the whole PIPELINE and find where the copilot is weak,
where context wastes tokens, and what's broken — not to make the copilot write good shaders (use a CHEAP
model and SIMPLE tasks; it will make mistakes, that's fine).

Features 026 (the harness) + 027 (interactive resume/dump). Everything dogfood lives under ONE dir:
`scripts/dogfood/` — the harness is `scripts/dogfood/harness.py`, scenarios are
`scripts/dogfood/scenarios/`, and ALL run artifacts (per-run project dirs, the data dir, JSON dumps,
traces, PNGs) land in `scripts/dogfood/runs/` (gitignored). The public import is unchanged:
`from scripts.dogfood import DogfoodHarness`. This skill is the operating manual — the process + every
gotcha already hit, so you don't re-discover them.

## 0. Prerequisites (the run fails without these)

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — required, billed. **Already `export`ed in `~/.bashrc`** (don't ask the
  maintainer for it). FOOTGUN: `~/.bashrc` has the standard "if not running interactively, return" guard
  at the top, and the export sits BELOW it — so a NON-interactive shell (the default for tool Bash calls)
  does NOT pick the key up (`echo $OPENROUTER_API_KEY` comes back empty). Run dogfood commands through an
  INTERACTIVE shell so the export fires: `bash -ic '<the uv run … one-liner>'`. (Verified 2026-06-09: the
  key surfaces under `bash -ic`, len 73, `sk-or-…`.) The harness reads the key at import, so it must be in
  the process env before `uv run` — which `bash -ic` guarantees.
- **Model:** the in-tree default (`CopilotIntegration.model`) is `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-mini` (cheap:
  ~USD 0.25 in / 2.00 out per Mtok, tool-call compatible, 400k ctx — no `$N` literals in this file:
  the skill runner substitutes `$0`/`$1`/… with invocation args), used automatically — no `OPENROUTER_MODEL`
  override needed. Chosen over grok: grok writes BAD GLSL (you can't dogfood the authoring pipeline on a
  model that can't write a shader); codex-mini is the cheap-but-competent-at-code pick. Set
  `OPENROUTER_MODEL` only to try a different model. Models go deprecated (grok-4-fast 404'd a prior run) —
  if a run 404s, `curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` and filter for the current cheap codex,
  confirm `tools` is in its `supported_parameters` (the agent rejects tool-incompatible models), bump the
  in-tree default.
- **This is a display-less Pi.** `glfw.init()` FAILS here; `import glfw`/`import imgui` SUCCEED. The whole
  point of the headless harness is to bypass glfw via a standalone EGL context.

## 1. Drive a scenario — ONE blocking `uv run` per turn (resume/dump)

> ⚠️ **DRIVE INTERACTIVELY — NEVER pre-script the reply sequence.** The scenarios are FREE-FORM GOALS
> with branch points (the `User:` / `if it does X, do Y` shape), not fixed dialogues. The dogfood tests
> whether YOU read each copilot reply and ADAPT the next message; a baked multi-turn `h.send(...)`
> progression replays a recording and defeats the entire point. Send ONE turn, READ the reply, THEN
> compose the next message. **A baked multi-turn driver is forbidden.**

The mechanism (feature 027): each turn is its OWN `uv run` process (inherently one blocking call). State
persists ON DISK — the harness `dump`s the conversation after the turn, and the NEXT process `resume`s it
via `create(project_dir=...)` with ZERO LLM calls (the conversation is NL-only-serialized; node edits are
already on disk). So you read turn N's JSON, think, then write turn N+1's command. No server, no background
process, no PID.

**Seeding the shader library (any mission that should exercise `SB_*` helpers):** the harness's
tmp data dir starts with an EMPTY lib — copy the canonical seed in BEFORE turn 1 and pass the SAME
`SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR` on every turn:
```
mkdir -p scripts/dogfood/runs/data-<run> \
  && cp -r shaderbox/resources/shader_lib scripts/dogfood/runs/data-<run>/shader_lib
env SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR=$PWD/scripts/dogfood/runs/data-<run> ... uv run ...
```
V3D shader-codegen cost (Pi): the driver compiles the final GPU code lazily at FIRST DRAW, on the
CPU — a heavy shader's first render pays it once (the old code-based glyphs paid ~20s; the
data-driven glyphs of 032 cut that to ~1s). Warm renders are fast (text 300x300 ~ tens of ms). If
a render burns 99% CPU for minutes it's first-draw codegen of an oversized shader, not a deadlock;
for time-sampled stills load the node directly on a standalone EGL context (no bridge timeout).

**Turn 1 (fresh project):**
```
env OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… uv run python -c '
from pathlib import Path
from scripts.dogfood import DogfoodHarness
h = DogfoodHarness.create()                          # seeded project (UV Mango / Media / Text)
# h = DogfoodHarness.create(seed_templates=False)    # empty -> create_node from scratch
h.send("Make the current shader output solid red. Keep it simple.")
h.drive_until_idle()                                 # pump worker+bridge; STOPS on a gate
h.render(size=400)                                   # 400x400 PNG (path echoed in the dump)
h.dump(Path("scripts/dogfood/runs/turn.json"))       # persist convo + write the JSON turn-result
h.release()'
cat scripts/dogfood/runs/turn.json                   # READ the result; note project_dir + data_dir
```
The JSON has `new_messages`, `assistant_text`, `open_gate`, `last_turn` (tokens/cost), `session_cost_usd`,
`last_render_path`, `trace_path`, and the two stable paths `project_dir` + `data_dir` to reuse next turn.
**Read the dumped `last_render_path` PNG** — the visual check is the whole point.

**Turn 2+ (resume — REUSE the same project_dir AND SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR from turn 1's dump):**
```
env OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR=<data_dir from turn.json> uv run python -c '
from pathlib import Path
from scripts.dogfood import DogfoodHarness
h = DogfoodHarness.create(project_dir=Path("<project_dir from turn.json>"))  # resumes the convo
h.send("<the message YOU chose after reading turn 1>")
h.drive_until_idle(); h.render(size=400)
h.dump(Path("scripts/dogfood/runs/turn.json")); h.release()'
cat scripts/dogfood/runs/turn.json
```
🔴 **`SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR` MUST be set on the COMMAND LINE before `uv run`** — the harness reads it at
import (the env block runs when `scripts.dogfood` is imported, before any `create()` arg). Setting it
in-script after import loses to the already-run `setdefault`. Same for the resume project_dir: it's a
`create()` arg, but the data dir is env-only.

**Gates are answered WITHIN one process — a gate CANNOT span two turns.** A gate pauses the worker
mid-turn; the worker dies on process exit and a gated turn is never persisted, so there is no "dump the
gate, resume, answer it". Decide the gate answer UP FRONT when you compose that turn's command:
```python
h.send("delete the Media node")
h.drive_until_idle()                       # stops on the gate
if h._open_gate() is not None:
    h.decline()                            # or approve() — YOU decide per the scenario
    h.drive_until_idle()                   # let the copilot react to the decision
h.dump(Path("scripts/dogfood/runs/turn.json"))
```
For an unconditional yes, `h.drive_until_idle(auto_approve_gates=True)` is the shortcut. (Answering a gate
based on reading its OWN prompt text first is the one thing this can't do — reserved for a future server,
`027` Out-of-scope.)

The scenarios live in `scripts/dogfood/scenarios/`. Read each `.md`, drive its arc turn-by-turn, judge its
`Human check:` against the trace + the rendered PNG. (REPL note: for ad-hoc poking you can still drive the
harness from one long-lived `python` REPL — `send` / `drive_until_idle` / `render` / `approve` / `decline`
/ `reload` — but for a real scenario run the one-blocking-call-per-turn shape above is the discipline that
keeps you honest about reading each reply.)

## 1a. Tool-coverage discipline — DELIBERATELY route through the cold tools

Run 2 fired only 5 of ~12 reachable tools (`create_node` / `read_shader` / `replace_lines` /
`insert_after` / `edit_shader`); the whole navigation/value/integration half stayed COLD (`grep`,
`read_lib`, `set_uniform`, `switch_node`, `delete_node`, `render_image`/`render_video`). A cheap model
takes the lazy path — it answers "what nodes exist?" from the project map instead of grepping, hard-codes a
constant instead of adding a tunable uniform, edits the current node instead of switching. So coverage
won't happen by accident; YOU (the driver) have to provoke it.

**Before composing each turn, ask: "which cold tool can THIS turn legitimately force?"** Prefer the phrasing
that routes through an unexercised tool, as long as it stays a natural mission move (never a fake "now call
grep" instruction — the agent must have a real reason):

- **`grep` / `read_lib`** — ask the agent to REUSE something it must first LOCATE: a `SB_*` helper by
  behavior not name ("reuse the library edge helper"), or "which shaders use `u_time`?". A bare "what nodes
  exist?" loses to the project map — make the thing live in the LIBRARY (not in the always-present map) so
  it has to grep + read_lib to find and read it.
- **`set_uniform`** — demand an ADJUSTABLE look and then DIAL it ("turn the glow up", "make it dimmer").
  A hard-coded constant can't be tuned; the agent must introduce a uniform and `set_uniform` a value.
- **`switch_node`** — with node A current, ask to edit node B by name. Edits with no target hit the
  current node, so the agent must `switch_node` to B first.
- **`delete_node`** — give it a genuine throwaway to remove. It's GATED — decide approve/decline UP FRONT
  when you compose that turn (a gate can't span turns; `/dogfood` §1).
- **`render_image` / `render_video`** — these are the COPILOT's own gated tools, distinct from the harness
  `h.render()`. Ask the AGENT to save the result to a file ("render this to a PNG"); drive that turn with
  `drive_until_idle(auto_approve_gates=True)`.

**The analyzer reports coverage, and thin coverage is a first-class finding.** Every run's report MUST
include the per-tool fired/not-fired table (report §4 / run-2 format) and call out any tool that stayed
cold — distinguishing "the scenario never pressured it" from "a pressure move aimed at it but the agent
dodged" (the latter is a behavioral finding about the model). Treat full reachable-surface coverage as a
run goal alongside the scenario's visual goal: a beautiful render that touched 5 tools is a worse run than
a rougher one that exercised 11. (`publish_*` precheck-fails in the harness — empty `ExporterRegistry` —
so it's NOT reachable; don't count it as a missed cold tool.)

**End every mission with a SWEEP turn.** The final-source audits show edit sediment in every
multi-turn shader (dead clamps, duplicate predicates, no-op guards narrated as fixes, stale names).
Before closing a mission, send one last turn: "sweep the shader: remove dead code, duplicate
logic and leftovers from the editing session; change no behavior" — it both cleans the artifact
and probes the agent's self-review.

## 2. The gotchas (hard-won — don't re-discover them)

- **Threading is worker + main-thread pump — NOT a sync bridge patch.** `CopilotSession` ALWAYS spawns a
  worker thread; the worker marshals GL ops to the main (context-owning) thread via `bridge.run_on_main`,
  which BLOCKS until drained. A sync patch (`run_on_main = fn()`) would run GL on the worker thread →
  EGL thread-affinity violation. The harness's `drive_until_idle` pumps `drain_bridge()` + `pump_events()`
  on the owning thread (mirrors `App`'s frame loop, `ui.py`). DON'T "simplify" this to a sync patch.
- **`render()` runs on a throwaway thread + pumps the bridge.** A DIRECT `render_image` call from the main
  thread DEADLOCKS (it enqueues a bridge op and blocks on a drain that never comes). The harness runs it on
  a helper thread and drains from the owner thread. Already handled — don't call `render_image` directly.
- **Env order: set BEFORE importing shaderbox.** `SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR` (isolation — never pollute the real
  library/creds; also the RESUME seam) + the two MESA overrides (`MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.6` /
  `MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=460`, for `#version 460` on V3D) are set at the TOP of
  `scripts/dogfood/harness.py` before the shaderbox imports, AND re-run whenever `scripts.dogfood` is
  imported. A caller-set `SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR` WINS (the `setdefault` no-ops) — so on resume you MUST pass it
  on the command line, never assign it in-script after import.
- **Resume = same project_dir + same SHADERBOX_DATA_DIR.** `create(project_dir=<existing>)` skips seeding,
  reloads the shaders, restores the conversation from `<project_dir>/copilot/conversation.json` (zero LLM
  calls). The data dir (lib + integrations) is separate and env-only — both must point at turn 1's dirs or
  the resume is half-restored. `dump`'s JSON echoes both paths so you copy them forward without bookkeeping.
- **`dump` uses its own cursor.** `drive_until_idle` advances the PRINT cursor; `dump` slices on a SEPARATE
  cursor, so `new_messages` reports the turn's output even after the prints. Don't expect `dump` to re-emit
  the restored conversation on a resume — that's already-seen by design.
- **EGL context is already current after creation** — no `make_current` call; `Node`/`Canvas` pick it up
  via `moderngl.get_context()`. (moderngl's stub mistypes `backend=` — the one sanctioned `# type: ignore`.)
- **The `GLFWError: not initialized` warning is benign** — `core.py` reads `glfw.get_time()` for the default
  `u_time` (returns 0.0, the static t=0 frame we want). The harness installs a no-op glfw error callback.
- **White-on-transparent renders eyeball as BLANK (all white).** The Read tool / viewers flatten alpha onto
  white, so a sticker-style render (the flagship pattern) looks empty. Composite onto a dark background
  before judging: PIL `alpha_composite` onto e.g. (25,25,40), save, THEN Read. The render facts' `ink %`
  tells you whether there is alpha-carried content worth compositing.
- **🔴 `GLError 1282 (invalid operation) glUseProgram(0)` is a REAL pipeline bug, not harness noise.** It
  fires spuradically on bridge-marshalled create_node/replace_lines (the persist→render path) under the
  standalone context — the same headless GL-quirk as node teardown. The copilot RECOVERS (retries), so a
  run still completes, but log it as a finding. (Tracked in `todo.md`.) Don't mistake it for a harness fault.
- **Multi-file read needs an UNSOLVABLE-without-reading task.** "Merge node A and B" is solved from the
  model's own knowledge — a cheap model won't bother to `read_shader` the references. To actually exercise
  multi-file read, the task must REQUIRE the other node's content (e.g. "use the EXACT color/constant from
  node X"). Otherwise the probe is inconclusive.
- **`session_cost_usd` accumulates across turns**; `state.last_turn` has `context_tokens`/`reply_tokens`/
  `cost_usd` per turn. The trace's `llm_response` events have per-iteration `usage: in=/out=/cost=`.

## 3. Reading the trace (the context/token analysis)

`h.trace_path` → a plain-text transcript. Per turn it logs: `turn_start` (user_text + history +
eager_tools), each `llm_request` (the FULL messages array — system prompt + project map + working set +
the native `tools=` block — + max_tokens), each `llm_response` (finish_reason + text + tool_calls +
`usage: in/out/cost`), each `tool_call` (name + args + ok + result), `turn_done` (summed usage).

**Run `uv run python scripts/dogfood/analyze.py <data_dir>` to auto-extract** tool coverage, the per-turn
iteration/token/cost table, recoveries, and the token-growth shape — paste its markdown block into the
report §2/§4/§5 instead of hand-summing. (The per-section context_breakdown — system prompt vs project map
vs working set vs `tools=` block — remains a separate deferred trace event, not yet automated; for that,
split one `llm_request` block by hand, ~chars/4.)

**Load-bearing token note:** the `turn_done` `in=` is the CUMULATIVE billed input (the SUM of every
iteration's input — e.g. 68k on the 4-node read turn); the real per-turn CONTEXT size is the max
per-iteration `in=` (analyze.py's `peak_iter_in_tokens`, ~10k on that turn). Don't report the cumulative
figure as "context size" — it's the cost driver, the peak is the context-size driver.

## 4. The report (template + analyzer flow)

The report is half AUTO (filled by the analyzer from logs — you never hand-sum), half HUMAN (your
judgment). Flow:

1. Copy `scripts/dogfood/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` → `ai_docs/features/NNN_dogfood_report_<run>.md` (durable,
   roadmap-linked finding — stays in `ai_docs/features/`, NOT under `scripts/dogfood/`).
2. Run the analyzer to fill the **AUTO slots** (run label/model/turns/cost, per-turn table, render
   list, tool-coverage table, cold tools, token range/peak, cost range, token-growth, recovery summary):
   ```
   uv run python scripts/dogfood/analyze.py <data_dir> \
       --template scripts/dogfood/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md \
       --report-out ai_docs/features/NNN_dogfood_report_<run>.md
   ```
   (Pass `--model <id>` if the run used a non-default model not recorded in the data dir's
   `integrations.json`.)
3. Write the **7 HUMAN sections** by hand — the things a log can't give you:
   - **Verdict** — mechanism works Y/N, overall conclusion.
   - **Per-render visual eyeball** — open each PNG with Read; correct/wrong, quadrants, did a tuned uniform
     visibly change anything. (NOT automatable — you have to look.)
   - **Honesty / visual-blindness** — did the agent CLAIM a visual result it couldn't see, and was it right?
   - **TODOs**, split: (a) improve the COPILOT/agent, (b) improve the DOGFOODING framework/harness/skill,
     (c) improve the LIBRARY.

The template's inline comments mark every `{{AUTO:...}}` vs `{{HUMAN:...}}` slot. Treat full reachable-tool
coverage (§1a) as a run goal — the AUTO coverage table makes a thin run visible.

## 5. Clean up

No throwaway driver to delete (the one-blocking-call-per-turn shape has none). All run artifacts live under
`scripts/dogfood/runs/` (gitignored). To free disk between runs:
`rm -rf scripts/dogfood/runs/{data-*,proj-*,*.json}` (regenerable — the harness recreates `runs/` on the
next run; the dumps are the stray `*.json`). NOTE: these data dirs hold the LIVE OpenRouter key in their
`integrations.json`, so purging them is also key hygiene. Keep the report (durable, in `ai_docs/features/`);
if a reviewer needs your trace, copy the specific `trace_path` somewhere durable before the purge. The
harness + analyzer + template + scenarios + this skill stay. File prioritized findings into `todo.md` with
concrete triggers.

## 6. Improve this skill

This is a LIVING skill. Each run, if you hit a new gotcha or the report format wants a new section, ADD it
here so the next run is smoother. The maintainer wants the dogfooding itself to get more convenient over
time — the report's "improve the DOGFOODING framework" TODO bucket (§4 HUMAN section b) is where those
findings start, and they flow back HERE (the skill) or into `scripts/dogfood/analyze.py` (the analyzer).
